TODO:

✔️ Use ES6 class syntax
✔️ Adds methods to prototype rather than instance 
✔️ Use appropiate names in vars, attrs and methods
✔️ Replace the error handler logic when start/stop are clicked twice
✔️ Remove attributes in closing HTML tags - This was a typo
✔️ Change time tracker logic. Don't count time based on setInterval iterations
✔️ Don't put the script tag after body - Changed using defer
✔️ Only throw when you are planning to catch 
✔️ Stopwatches should not know about the DOM - changed

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
🔥 Use private, public and static props and methods
🔥 Give a killer look to UI
🔥 Add a interval record table (time elapsed when user press stop button)
🔥 Do the interval record table optional
